Shrubs and trees in poor condition are likely to attract
insect pests and are susceptible to damage when
attacked. Healthy plants have a natural ability to ward
off insects and diseases. This is especially true for plants
living in their native habitat. Arid urban environments
increase the potential for insect problems in shrubs and
trees. Urban stress conditions include extreme
temperatures, salty irrigation water, and heavy soils.
Further, many trees and shrubs av ailable in nurseries are
not adapted to arid climates. Incorrect maintenance
practices also create plant stress, and stressed plants
become susceptible to insects and diseases. T o prevent
or reduce insect and disease problems, follow proper
planting, pruning, irrigation, and weed control practices.
Making a diagnosis
Careful diagnosis is necessary to determine the cause of
a problem. Is the plant getting enough water or too
much? Has it been over-fertilized or sprayed with
pesticide or herbicide? Are insects visible? After a list
of symptoms is noted and the maintenance history of the
plant determined, consult the local Extension Office or a
knowledgeable nursery person. A qualif ied person may
diagnose the problem over the telephone or provide a
suitable reference.

Xeriscape
The word xeriscape is derived from the Greek word
xeros meaning dry. Xeriscape refers to water -conserving
landscapes designed to harmonize with the existing
environment. Xeriscape gardening recognizes native and
other drought resistant vegetation as visually and
aesthetically pleasing.
Xeriscape plants are drought resistant, meaning they can
survive extended periods of drought with little or no
supplemental irrigation. Plants suitable for our desert
climate include native plants — plants indigenous to the
local area — and plants from other arid climates. These
kinds of plants are tolerant of desert-like conditions —
low humidity, lo w rainfall, and alkaline soils.
Xeriscape gardens require less care than traditional
landscapes. Some maintenance, however , is required
and this brochure is designed to help home gardeners
and landscape professionals properly select and maintain
xeriscape plants for maximum beauty and plant health.

Plant Selection at the Nursery
Proper plant selection and placement will avoid future
landscape problems. Before selecting a plant decide its
intended purpose. For example, will it be used for
shade, groundcover, pri vacy? Consider growth pattern;
leaf size and texture; presence of flowers, fruits, thorns;
and especially size at maturity. Determine how much
landscape space is available and identify the best
location for the plant. Is the location sunny or shady?
What are the soil conditions?
Well-spaced br anches
Evenly netted root system
Select plants that look healthy — good tissue color,
absence of insects and tissue damage — and that do not
flop around when gently shaken. Ask about the plant’ s
care requirements and potential problems associated
with the plant. Select plants that are well adapted to
local environmental stresses: low rainfall, lo w humidity,
and alkaline soils.
Look for good branching structure in trees. A void
narrow angled branching and poor branch spacing. Be
sure the tree does not bend to an extreme angle when the
nursery stake is removed. Avoid trees with bark damage,
and if possible choose one with small branches still
attached to the lower trunk. Be sure that the tree’s main
stem tapers towards the top (decreases in diameter).Well-Developed Nursery TreeAsk to see the root system of the plant and look for a
well-developed root system that is not root-bound.
Roots should be light in color and should not be growing
out of the drainage hole of the container. Do not
purchase a plant if girdling, kinking, or circling roots are
found. Large plants in small containers should be
avoided. Good root system development is mor e
important than plant size.

Once the plant is purchased, store it in a shady location
keeping the roots moist; plant as soon as possible.

Consider the mature size of a plant before choosing
its location . For example, a large tree should not be
planted underneath an overhead utility line! If involved
in an extensive planting project, call Blue Stake (1-800-
782-5348) to determine the location of buried utilities to
avoid unfortunate mishaps.
When to Plant
Year-round planting in the desert is possible. The ideal
planting time, however , is late fall (except for frost
sensitive species) when soil temperatures are warm and
air temperatures cooler. This encourages rapid root
establishment. Late spring is also good, although root
establishment may be slower.
Preparation of Planting Hole
Prepare a hole three to five times as wide as the diameter
of the root ball and no deeper than its height. If this
disturbs the roots of nearby plants, reduce the width to
two times the diameter of the root ball. Before planting
make sure that the sides of the hole are rough and
sloping.
Fill the hole with water prior to planting to check the
drainage. The water should drain within 12-24 hours. If
caliche or hardpan is preventing drainage, dig a chimney
or a channel through the caliche layer before planting.
Soil Preparation
The addition of organic matter — compost, or forest
mulch — is not necessary when planting native plants
and plants from other arid climates because they are
accustomed to alkaline soils (high pH) which naturally
have a very low percentage of or ganic matter. T o
increase the water holding capacity of poor soils (very
rocky and/or sandy), incorporate some fine-textured
native soil into the planting hole.
How to Plant
Remove the plant carefully from the container without
breaking the root ball. Cut off any girdled, kinked, or
circling roots with a sharp knife or pruners. Slice the
root ball lengthwise approximately one-inch deep in
two or three places. Place the plant in the planting hole and back fill with
native soil. The top of the root ball should be level
with or slightly above the existing soil surface .
Planting too deeply can cause crown rot. Do not
compact the soil by standing on it, use water to settle the
soil.
After Planting
Irrigate the root ball and the planting area immediately,
taking care that the root ball remains level with the soil
surface even after irrigation. Remove the nursery
stake. If necessary, re-stake the plant follo wing the
guidelines in the Tree Staking section. Avoid pruning at
this time. A mulch should be applied to maintain soil
moisture, but keep it a few inches away from the base
of the plant. Fertilizer is not required at planting.
Nitrogen applications may actually delay root
establishment.

Trees should never be permanently staked. Staked
trees develop weak wood and may also dev elop damaged
bark. Staking is not necessary if the tree can support
itself after the nursery stake is removed. In very windy
locations temporary staking may be beneficial, even if
the tree can support itself. If the tree cannot support
itself, stake the tree following these guidelines:
Stakes
Use two stakes per tree. Round, two-inch diameter
wooden poles are preferred. Do not use metal pipes or
rebar . Stakes should be placed outside the root ball at a
right angle to the ground level and perpendicular to the
direction of the prevailing wind. Cut the stakes a few
inches above the location of the new ties to prev ent
rubbing damage to the tree.
Tie Material
Tie material should be wide, smooth and elastic, for
example, polyethylene tape, plastic webbing, or wire
covered with hose or rubber tubing. Uncovered rope,
wire or string will damage the tree. Install stakes in
undisturbed soil2“ square
or round
wooden stakesSmooth,
wide tie

Stake PlacementTie Placement
Care should be taken when placing the ties. Loosely
hold the tree trunk at its base. Slowly move your hands
up the trunk and determine the point at which the tree
returns to an upright position. Place the ties
approximately six inches above this point with one tie on
each stake. A second set of ties may be used between the
base of the plant and the ties already in place if the tree is
still unstable.
Ties should hold the trunk firmly but not restrict
movement from the wind. Movement is necessary for
trunk development. The trunk and tie should move as a
unit. Inspect the trunk monthly for damage and loosen
the ties as the tree grows.

Tie Removal
Stakes and ties should be removed as soon as
possible . Loosen the ties periodically to determine if the
tree can support itself. Although some trees may need to
be staked for a year or longer, most will be able to
support themselves within one year.

It is not easy to determine a plant’s exact water needs,
because many factors influence the amount of water a
plant requires—plant type, soils, weather, location, and
root depth. Although many desert-adapted plants can
survive on rainfall, supplemental irrigation will be
required for at least one growing season to promote
establishment. Once established (approximately
2-3 years), irrigation may be necessary only during
dry periods.
How T o Irrigate
Light, frequent irrigations create shallow , weak root
systems. Deep, less frequent irrigations encourage
deep strong root systems that can tolerate longer
periods of drought. Mature root systems are typically

Root
depthIf using flood irrigation, provide a berm or form an
irrigation border beyond the canopy drip line to prevent
runoff. As the tree matures, mo ve the berm outward to
compensate for the expanding rooting area. If using a
soaker hose or drip irrigation, a berm is not necessary.
As the plant matures and the root system expands, add
more emitters at and beyond the dripline. In general,
sandy soils will require more closely spaced emitters
than clay soils due to the narrow wetting pattern.
Re-irrigate when the soil dries out half-way. Feeling the
soil, using a soil probe, and observing plant stress will
help determine when to re-irrigate. Stress will occur
more rapidly during warmer summer months and less
rapidly during spring and fall months. Evergreen plants
will require infrequent, deep winter irrigations.
Groundcover Irrigation6 - 12"
Root depth1½ -4 times wider than the plant canopy. Rooting depths
vary depending on plant type. Always irrigate the
entire depth and width of the plant root zone
regardless of the time of year . Irrigation frequency is
dependent on how quickly the soil dries out. Soil texture
and plant rooting depth will determine the length of
irrigation time; water will move down quickly in sandy
soils and slowly in clay soils. Use a soil probe, a long
screwdriver , or a piece of rebar to determine how deeply
and widely the water has moved. When dry soil is
reached the device should stop. T o prevent runoff don’t
apply water faster than the soil can absorb it. Use drip
irrigation, a soaker hose, or a slowly dripping garden
hose to reduce the flow.

During the warmer months, irrigate at night or early
morning (between 3 - 8 a.m.) to reduce water loss due to
evaporation and wind. Soil texture and weather
conditions will determine the frequency of irrigations.
Observe plants regularly for signs of water stress such as
wilted, curled or drooping leaves; yellowing or drop off
of older leaves or dead stems or branches. Signs of
excess water include: brittle leaves remaining on the
plant; wilted shoot tips; soft, smelly tissue; and the
presence of algae or mushrooms.

Mature Tree Little pruning is required to maintain the beauty and
natural form of xeriscape plants. If plants are located in
areas with adequate space, the need for regular pruning
will be greatly reduced or eliminated. However , some
minor pruning may be necessary at times and can be
beneficial to the plant if done properly.
For very large tree pruning, or trees in contact with
power lines or electrical conductors, hire a certified
arborist (contact your local Extension Office or check
the Y ellow Pages). Pruning can be dangerous if done by
an inexperienced person.
Plants should not be pruned immediately after
planting except to remove dead, diseased or
protruding branches . Once a plant has become
established — approximately 1-2 years — conservative
pruning can begin. Always prune to retain the natural
shape of the species. While pruning, stand back to view
the developing shape. Never remo ve more than 1/3 of a
plant during one season (the exception is rejuvenation of
old plant material). If in doubt about what to remove,
don’t.
Trees: Branches along the lower trunk should be
allowed to grow for at least two years before remov al
because they encourage strong trunk growth, protect the
trunk from sunburn and reduce resistance to wind.
Remember that trees should never be topped
(stubbed). If it is necessary to lower the height, prune
back selectively . Always prune back to a side branch
that is at least 1/3 - 1/2 the diameter of the size of the
branch being cut off.
When to Prune
Light pruning may be done anytime if proper pruning
techniques are followed. For deciduous plants, heavier
pruning should be done when plants are dormant—after
leaf drop in fall or before bud break in early spring; for
evergreen plants, late fall or early spring is best. In
general, avoid pruning when plants appear stressed or
during periods of prolonged heat or high humidity.Pruning
--- Page 9 ---
To increase bloom, prune spring bloomers just after
periods of bloom and summer bloomers before bud
break in spring. For plants with more than one blooming
season, prune after the fall blooming period.
How to Prune
Use the proper pruning tools and make sure they are
sharp and clean. A 10% bleach solution will sterilize
tools sufficiently . Use a pruning saw for branches
greater than one inch thick. Always make smooth cuts
and avoid crushing plant tissues. Be sure to use the
proper pruning cut to get the desired result. Pruning
methods include thinning, heading, pinching and
rejuvenating.

behind. Do not use pruning paint or any kind of
sealant.Tree Heading to Control Height

shrubs. In most cases, however , shrubs require less
pruning. A void shearing shrubs into unnatural forms
(boxes and balls) and encourage natural growth form. If
shearing or hedging is done keep the bottom of the shrub
wider in diameter than the top and include some
thinning cuts. This allows greater sunlight penetration
and encourages internal leaf growth.
Pinching may be done to promote the development of a
bushier, more compact shrub . Pinching can take place at
any time.
Pruning to rejuvenate summer and fall blooming shrubs
that have become woody should take place during late
winter or early spring. For spring blooming shrubs,
rejuvenate after the bloom period, but before hot
weather. Thinning should also be done in the same
sequence.
If frost damage occurs, remove the damaged tissue when
new growth appears in spring. For plants that routinely
freeze in the winter, prune back to the plant base in late
winter, approximately six inches.
Plants such as cactus, yuccas, desert spoons, agaves, and
ocotillos do not require routine pruning. Dead or
diseased parts or old flower stalks can be removed
as needed.

Pinching to Encourage Dense GrowthCutNew growth New growthXeriscape plants usually do not require fertilizer unless
nutrient deficiencies occur, which is uncommon.
Fertilizing can be used to encourage rapid growth, but
this will also increase water use and pruning
requirements.
Nitrogen and iron are the two nutrients most commonly
lacking or unavailable in desert soils. Nitrogen levels are
low because arid soils lack organic matter . Iron is
plentiful but deficiencies occur because iron availability
(solubility) in alkaline soils is limited. In addition,
weather extremes (cold, wet, or extended dry conditions)
can further reduce available iron.
Both nitrogen deficiency and iron deficiency can
produce chlorosis — yellowing of plant tissues. This is
most typically seen in non-native plants. Nitrogen
deficiency causes the older leaves of the plant to become
chlorotic first; new leaves may follo w. Nitrogen
deficient plants require fertilization. When iron is
deficient plant veins are green and the rest of the leaf is
yellow. Ne w leaves become chlorotic first; older leaves
may follow. Plants with an iron def iciency may recover
on their own when the weather is warmer and drier.
If not, applications of chelated forms of iron may help.
Although phosphorus and potassium are plentiful in
desert soils, phosphorus can be incorporated into the soil
at the time of planting to increase blooming of flowering
plants.
Fertilizer Types
There are two kinds of fertilizers: inorganic and organic.
Inorganic fertilizers, such as ammonium nitrate,
ammonium sulfate and urea are derived from natural
mineral sources. They are highly soluble and release
nutrients very quickly. Use an inor ganic fertilizer on
plants showing a nutrient deficiency because they release
nutrients rapidly and uniformly.
Natural organic fertilizers are derived from animal and
plant sources such as compost, blood and bone meal.
Always use well-decomposed natural organic material.
Synthetic organics include: ureaformaldehyde (UF),
isobutylidene diurea (IBDU), and sulfur-coated urea
--- Page 11 ---
uniformly and more slowly depending on weather
conditions. In general, organic fertilizers will need to be
applied less frequently due to their slow release and
inorganics more frequently due to their rapid release.
When to Fertilize
Apply fertilizers just before or during a growth spurt.
(Early spring to late summer) A void fertilizing in late
fall. This stimulates tender growth that may be frost
sensitive. Plants will not take up nutrients when they are
not actively growing — during very hot, cold, or wet
conditions. Fertilize before a scheduled irrigation, not
after the soil is already wet.
How to Fertilize
Always irrigate sufficiently when applying fertilizer .
Nutrients must be dissolved in water to enter the roots of
the plant. W atering too deeply can cause nutrients to
move below the root zone. Phosphorus fertilizers are
useless as topdressing and need to be incorporated into
the soil. Always read and follow the label directions
for application rates and guidelines . Mulches
A mulch is a layer of insulation between the soil surface
and the atmosphere. Mulches can reduce evaporation,
erosion and compaction; moderate soil temperatures;
increase water penetration; protect roots from
mechanical injury; and reduce weed growth. Mulches
can be used to cover large areas, reducing the need
for vegetation.
There are two types of mulches: organic and
inorganic. Organic mulches that work well in the
landscape include coarse material, such as wood chips or
bark, that will not blow away . Apply organic mulches
2 to 4 inches deep away from the base of the plant and
out beyond the drip line. As org anic mulches
decompose, they need to be replaced. Examples of
inorganic mulches include decomposed granite, pea
gravel and river rock. Apply inorganic mulches 1/2 to 2
inches deep. All mulches should be kept 6 to 8 inches
away from the trunk or base of the main stem.
Weed Control
Consistent weed control is important because weeds
compete with landscape plants for water, nutrients, and
sunlight. Eliminate weeds before they set seed to reduce
future weed problems. Manual weed removal can be
effective when populations are low . In extreme cases,
however , chemical control may be necessary. Black
plastic is not recommended for weed control.
To pre vent future weed seeds from germinating, treat the
soil with a pre-emergent. Do not use pre-emergent in
areas which contain seeds of desirable plants, such as
wildflowers. Mulches can reduce weed seed
germination by preventing exposure to sunlight.
If a weed problem seems to justify the use of chemicals,
contact your local Extension Office to determine which
to use and proper uses. Always read and follow label
instructions.

DESERT FOODS FOR TOMORROW: PLANTING THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE
PRICKLY PEAR CACTUS
Opun%a spp.
Spanish: nopal de cas%lla
O’odham: nawǐ na:k (pads) i:bhai (fruit)
Prickly pear cactus is a must-have for a healthy,
sustainable, and climate-smart diet. These hardy
plants are well-suited to hot, dry desert condiBons and
nutrient-poor soils. Their flaDened, jointed stems
(pads) store water and are covered in spines that
protect the plant from hungry and thirsty animals.
These spines are actually modified leaves that also
help plants prevent water loss. The waxy coaBng on
the surface of the cactus pads helps seal in moisture.
Prickly pear cacB are nutriBous and easy to grow.
Both the young green pads and the ripe fruits are
edible. A few key Bps will have you enjoying these
plants in your garden and on your plate—and
providing food and refuge for local wildlife—all
without a costly water bill.

Origin and History
Desert dwellers throughout North America have long
used prickly pear cacB for food and medicine. The
Sonoran Desert is home to at least 18 different species
of wild prickly pear cactus. The fruits and pads of some
naBve species, like Engelmann prickly pear (Opun%a
engelmannii), are edible. But beware, the dense spines
and higher amounts of oxalic acid in naBve species
require extra care when preparing.
DomesBcated prickly pears have been culBvated
specifically for edible fruits and pads and have fewer
spines and low acid levels. The Indian fig cactus
(Opun%a ficus-indica) can be found in backyards and Ripe fruits of the naBve Engelmann prickly. Credit: Mart

Central Mexico before the arrival of Europeans. Despite
having been a staple of desert diets for centuries, today prickly pear cactus is oWen overlooked as a food
crop, especially in the United States. Prolonged drought and recent record-breaking heat waves,
however, are encouraging us to re-think food producBon. Rising temperatures and dwindling water
resources will make growing less hardy, but familiar, commercial crops less and less feasible. Desert food
plants like the prickly pear cactus could be the key to more sustainable and resilient local food system.

HarvesBng and Preparing Cactus Pads
• Find cactus pads at Mexican grocery stores or harvest from
your own yard or neighborhood.
• Harvest young, bright green pads that sBll have cone-
shaped, fleshy leaves. Older pads are woody.
• Harvest in the morning (when acid content is low) by
cucng the young pad near its base with a sharp knife.
• Hold pads with tongs to avoid the Bny, hair like spines
called glochids, which can get stuck in hands and fingers.
• Singe off spines and glochids or remove with a knife and
trim all the way around the edge of the pad. Young pad of the Indian fig cactus.

• Slice cleaned pads according to recipe and boil, sauté, or
grill. Cooking helps reduce the slime (mucilage), which some people don’t enjoy.
¡CAUTION! Cactus pads contain oxalic acid which causes diges%ve problems in large amounts. Cooking
neutralizes these effects. Young pads and domes%cated varie%es have lower acid levels.
